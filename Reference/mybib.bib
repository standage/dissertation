abstract = "We evaluate a number of computer programs designed to predict the structure of protein coding genes in genomic DNA sequences. Computational gene identification is set to play an increasingly important role in the development of the genome projects, as emphasis turns from mapping to large-scale sequencing. The evaluation presented here serves both to assess the current status of the problem and to identify the most promising approaches to ensure further progress. The programs analyzed were uniformly tested on a large set of vertebrate sequences with simple gene structure, and several measures of predictive accuracy were computed at the nucleotide, exon, and protein product levels. The results indicated that the predictive accuracy of the programs analyzed was lower than originally found. The accuracy was even lower when considering only those sequences that had recently been entered and that did not show any similarity to previously entered sequences. This indicates that the programs are overly dependent on the particularities of the examples they learn from. For most of the programs, accuracy in this test set ranged from 0.60 to 0.70 as measured by the Correlation Coefficient (where 1.0 corresponds to a perfect prediction and 0.0 is the value expected for a random prediction), and the average percentage of exons exactly identified was less than 50\%. Only those programs including protein sequence database searches showed substantially greater accuracy. The accuracy of the programs was severely affected by relatively high rates of sequence errors. Since the set on which the programs were tested included only relatively short sequences with simple gene structure, the accuracy of the programs is likely to be even lower when used for large uncharacterized genomic sequences with complex structure. While in such cases, programs currently available may still be of great use in pinpointing the regions likely to contain exons, they are far from being powerful enough to elucidate its genomic structure completely."

PlantGDB provides annotated transcript assemblies for >100 plant species, with transcripts mapped to their cognate genomic context where available, integrated with a variety of sequence analysis tools and web services. For 14 plant species with emerging or complete genome sequence, PlantGDB's genome browsers (xGDB) serve as a graphical interface for viewing, evaluating and annotating transcript and protein alignments to chromosome or bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based genome assemblies. Annotation is facilitated by the integrated yrGATE module for community curation of gene models. Novel web services at PlantGDB include Tracembler, an iterative alignment tool that generates contigs from GenBank trace file data and BioExtract Server, a web-based server for executing custom sequence analysis workflows. PlantGDB also hosts a plant genomics research outreach portal (PGROP) that facilitates access to a large number of resources for research and training.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:The ever-increasing number of sequenced and annotated genomes has made management of their annotations a significant undertaking, especially for large eukaryotic genomes containing many thousands of genes. Typically, changes in gene and transcript numbers are used to summarize changes from release to release, but these measures say nothing about changes to individual annotations, nor do they provide any means to identify annotations in need of manual review.RESULTS:In response, we have developed a suite of quantitative measures to better characterize changes to a genome's annotations between releases, and to prioritize problematic annotations for manual review. We have applied these measures to the annotations of five eukaryotic genomes over multiple releases - H. sapiens, M. musculus, D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, and C. elegans.CONCLUSION:Our results provide the first detailed, historical overview of how these genomes' annotations have changed over the years, and demonstrate the usefulness of these measures for genome annotation management.},

@article{Guigo2000,
abstract = {One of the first useful products from the human genome will be a set of predicted genes. Besides its intrinsic scientific interest, the accuracy and completeness of this data set is of considerable importance for human health and medicine. Though progress has been made on computational gene identification in terms of both methods and accuracy evaluation measures, most of the sequence sets in which the programs are tested are short genomic sequences, and there is concern that these accuracy measures may not extrapolate well to larger, more challenging data sets. Given the absence of experimentally verified large genomic data sets, we constructed a semiartificial test set comprising a number of short single-gene genomic sequences with randomly generated intergenic regions. This test set, which should still present an easier problem than real human genomic sequence, mimics the \~{}200kb long BACs being sequenced. In our experiments with these longer genomic sequences, the accuracy of GENSCAN, one of the most accurate ab initio gene prediction programs, dropped significantly, although its sensitivity remained high. Conversely, the accuracy of similarity-based programs, such as GENEWISE, PROCRUSTES, and BLASTX, was not affected significantly by the presence of random intergenic sequence, but depended on the strength of the similarity to the protein homolog. As expected, the accuracy dropped if the models were built using more distant homologs, and we were able to quantitatively estimate this decline. However, the specificities of these techniques are still rather good even when the similarity is weak, which is a desirable characteristic for driving expensive follow-up experiments. Our experiments suggest that though gene prediction will improve with every new protein that is discovered and through improvements in the current set of tools, we still have a long way to go before we can decipher the precise exonic structure of every gene in the human genome using purely computational methodology.},

abstract="Accurate gene structure annotation is a fundamental but somewhat elusive goal of genome projects, as witnessed by the fact that (model) genomes typically undergo several cycles of re-annotation. In many cases, it is not only different versions of annotations that need to be compared but also different sources of annotation of the same genome, derived from distinct gene prediction workflows. Such comparisons are of interest to annotation providers, prediction software developers, and end-users, who all need to assess what is common and what is different among distinct annotation sources. We developed ParsEval, a software application for pairwise comparison of sets of gene structure annotations. ParsEval calculates several statistics that highlight the similarities and differences between the two sets of annotations provided. These statistics are presented in an aggregate summary report, with additional details provided as individual reports specific to non-overlapping, gene-model-centric genomic loci. Genome browser styled graphics embedded in these reports help visualize the genomic context of the annotations. Output from ParsEval is both easily read and parsed, enabling systematic identification of problematic gene models for subsequent focused analysis.",

abstract ={Summary: Limitations of genome sequencing techniques have led to dozens of assembly algorithms, none of which is perfect. A number of methods for comparing assemblers have been developed, but none is yet a recognized benchmark. Further, most existing methods for comparing assemblies are only applicable to new assemblies of finished genomes; the problem of evaluating assemblies of previously unsequenced species has not been adequately considered. Here, we present QUAST—a quality assessment tool for evaluating and comparing genome assemblies. This tool improves on leading assembly comparison software with new ideas and quality metrics. QUAST can evaluate assemblies both with a reference genome, as well as without a reference. QUAST produces many reports, summary tables and plots to help scientists in their research and in their publications. In this study, we used QUAST to compare several genome assemblers on three datasets. QUAST tables and plots for all of them are available in the Supplementary Material, and interactive versions of these reports are on the QUAST website.Availability: http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quastContact: gurevich@bioinf.spbau.ruSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract="High-throughput RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the preferred technique for studying gene expression differences between biological samples and for discovering novel isoforms, though the techniques to analyze the resulting data are still immature. One pre-processing step that is widely but heterogeneously applied is trimming, in which low quality bases, identified by the probability that they are called incorrectly, are removed. However, the impact of trimming on subsequent alignment to a genome could influence downstream analyses including gene expression estimation; we hypothesized that this might occur in an inconsistent manner across different genes, resulting in differential bias.",

abstract ={Genomes of eusocial insects code for dramatic examples of phenotypic plasticity and social organization. We compared the genomes of seven ants, the honeybee, and various solitary insects to examine whether eusocial lineages share distinct features of genomic organization. Each ant lineage contains ~4,000 novel genes, but only 64 of these genes are conserved among all seven ants. Many gene families have been expanded in ants, notably those involved in chemical communication (e.g., desaturases and odorant receptors). Alignment of the ant genomes revealed reduced purifying selection compared to Drosophila without significantly reduced synteny. Correspondingly, ant genomes exhibit dramatic divergence of non-coding regulatory elements, however extant conserved regions are enriched for novel non-coding RNAs and transcription factor binding sites. Comparison of orthologous gene promoters between eusocial and solitary species revealed significant regulatory evolution in both cis (e.g., CREB) and trans (e.g., Forkhead) for nearly 2000 genes, many of which exhibit phenotypic plasticity. Our results emphasize that genomic changes can occur remarkably fast in ants, as two recently diverged leaf-cutter ant species exhibit faster accumulation of species-specific genes and greater divergence in regulatory elements compared to other ants or Drosophila. Thus, while the "socio-genomes" of ants and the honeybee are broadly characterized by a pervasive pattern of divergence in gene composition and regulation, they preserve lineage-specific regulatory features linked to eusociality. We propose that changes in gene regulation played a key role in the origins of insect eusociality, whereas changes in gene composition were more relevant for lineage-specific eusocial adaptations.},

abstract = {Motivation: The problem of finding the genes in eukaryotic DNA sequences by computational methods is still not satisfactorily solved. Gene finding programs have achieved relatively high accuracy on short genomic sequences but do not perform well on longer sequences with an unknown number of genes in them. Here existing programs tend to predict many false exons. Results: We have developed a new program, AUGUSTUS, for the ab initio prediction of protein coding genes in eukaryotic genomes. The program is based on a Hidden Markov Model and integrates a number of known methods and submodels. It employs a new way of modeling intron lengths. We use a new donor splice site model, a new model for a short region directly upstream of the donor splice site model that takes the reading frame into account and apply a method that allows better GC-content dependent parameter estimation. AUGUSTUS predicts on longer sequences far more human and drosophila genes accurately than the ab initio gene prediction programs we compared it with, while at the same time being more specific.

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:In general, gene function prediction can be formalized as a classification problem based on machine learning technique. Usually, both labeled positive and negative samples are needed to train the classifier. For the problem of gene function prediction, however, the available information is only about positive samples. In other words, we know which genes have the function of interested, while it is generally unclear which genes do not have the function, i.e. the negative samples. If all the genes outside of the target functional family are seen as negative samples, the imbalanced problem will arise because there are only a relatively small number of genes annotated in each family. Furthermore, the classifier may be degraded by the false negatives in the heuristically generated negative samples.RESULTS:In this paper, we present a new technique, namely Annotating Genes with Positive Samples (AGPS), for defining negative samples in gene function prediction. With the defined negative samples, it is straightforward to predict the functions of unknown genes. In addition, the AGPS algorithm is able to integrate various kinds of data sources to predict gene functions in a reliable and accurate manner. With the one-class and two-class Support Vector Machines as the core learning algorithm, the AGPS algorithm shows good performances for function prediction on yeast genes.CONCLUSION:We proposed a new method for defining negative samples in gene function prediction. Experimental results on yeast genes show that AGPS yields good performances on both training and test sets. In addition, the overlapping between prediction results and GO annotations on unknown genes also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {Here we report the genome sequence of the honeybee Apis mellifera, a key model for social behaviour and essential to global ecology through pollination. Compared with other sequenced insect genomes, the A. mellifera genome has high A+T and CpG contents, lacks major transposon families, evolves more slowly, and is more similar to vertebrates for circadian rhythm, RNA interference and DNA methylation genes, among others. Furthermore, A. mellifera has fewer genes for innate immunity, detoxification enzymes, cuticle-forming proteins and gustatory receptors, more genes for odorant receptors, and novel genes for nectar and pollen utilization, consistent with its ecology and social organization. Compared to Drosophila, genes in early developmental pathways differ in Apis, whereas similarities exist for functions that differ markedly, such as sex determination, brain function and behaviour. Population genetics suggests a novel African origin for the species A. mellifera and insights into whether Africanized bees spread throughout the New World via hybridization or displacement.}

abstract ={Motivation: An increasing body of literature shows that genomes of eukaryotes can contain clusters of functionally related genes. Most approaches to identify gene clusters utilize microarray data or metabolic pathway databases to find groups of genes on chromosomes that are linked by common attributes. A generalized method that can find gene clusters regardless of the mechanism of origin would provide researchers with an unbiased method for finding clusters and studying the evolutionary forces that give rise to them.Results: We present an algorithm to identify gene clusters in eukaryotic genomes that utilizes functional categories defined in graph-based vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology (GO). Clusters identified in this manner need only have a common function and are not constrained by gene expression or other properties. We tested the algorithm by analyzing genomes of a representative set of species. We identified species-specific variation in percentage of clustered genes as well as in properties of gene clusters including size distribution and functional annotation. These properties may be diagnostic of the evolutionary forces that lead to the formation of gene clusters.Availability: A software implementation of the algorithm and example output files are available at http://fcg.tamu.edu/C_Hunter/.Contact: mthon@tamu.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
