\specialchapt{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}

I would like to acknowledge the phenomenal mentorship provided by VB and AT.
Working through many tough research problems over the years has been a bittersweet experience, but I treasure the critical thinking skills and healthy skepticism that they have passed on to me along the way.
If I have any success in my future scientific career it will be due in no small part to their instruction.

As excellent as was the program leadership provided by VB, JD, and KD, I acknowledge TS as the \textit{real} program director and applaud her indefatigable enthusiasm.
Her unparalleled impact is measured not only in students graduated, but in smiles given, in bureaucratic bombs defused, in seminar cookies consumed, and in sighs of relief made possible.

I express thanks to the five outstanding scientists on my graduate committee for holding me to the highest standards of scientific research and providing invaluable feedback on my work.
I count myself fortunate to have known my committee so well.

Most of all, I express my deepest gratitude to the love of my life, SS, without whose encouragement, support, counsel, and selflessness I would not be who I am today.
She is the yin to my yang, my peer in some ways, my superior in many ways, and my \texttt{\#BestFriendForever}.
This work is dedicated to her.
